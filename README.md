# Cypress-Postman-RestAssured Project

## Overview
This project has been created as a basic example of how to implement UI e2e and API automated tests. It demonstrates the following:

- Cypress - Writing e2e tests for a shopping website
    - As a customer if i search for "Heart of Oxford" I'd expect to see at least 2 shop directory tiles. If I click on any of the tiles, a new window should open with the merchant's correct website. Given a merchant’s website opens correctly, you are able to add 2 items to your cart. Validate the items have been added to your cart correctly. 
    These methods are agnostic of the store and should be able to work on any shop front that uses a similar design layout. 

- Postman - Writing API tests using Postman:
    - Assert the call responds with a successful status code 
    - Validate 10 records are returned 
    - Validate you can retrieve data for a single user 
    - Assert that the user “Mrs. Dennis Schulist” is contained in the list. 
- REST Assured - Writing Rest Assured tests for
    - Assert the call responds with a successful status code 
    - Validate 10 records are returned 
    - Validate you can retrieve data for a single user 
    - Assert that the user “Mrs. Dennis Schulist” is contained in the list.
